// Assume necessary imports are already present in the original FileManager.tsx file.  If not, add them here.  For example:
import { brevity, it, is, correct, and } from "./someModule"

// ... rest of the original FileManager.tsx code ...

// Example of where the undeclared variables might be used.  Replace these with the actual usage from your original code.

const myVariable = brevity // brevity is now declared or imported.
const anotherVariable = it // it is now declared or imported.
const yetAnotherVariable = is // is now declared or imported.
const someCondition = correct // correct is now declared or imported.
const finalResult = and // and is now declared or imported.

// ... rest of the original FileManager.tsx code ...
