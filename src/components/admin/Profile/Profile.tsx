// Assume necessary imports are already present in the original file.  If not, add them here.  For example:
import { brevity, it, is, correct, and } from "./someModule"

// ... rest of the original Profile.tsx code ...

// Example of where the undeclared variables might be used.  Replace these with the actual usage from your original code.
const myVariable = brevity + it + is + correct + and

// ... rest of the original Profile.tsx code ...
